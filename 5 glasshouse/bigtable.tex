%\caption[Treatment means, standard deviations and significance of ANOVA models.]{Mean and standard deviation (in parentheses) of measured gas exchange rates, biomass and functional traits for each combination of CO2 level and waterlogging treatments. Significant differences as determined by two-way ANOVA are denoted by the letters NS, C, W or I (NS = no significant effect of either treatment, C = significant effect of CO{\textsubscript{2}} level, W = significant effect of waterlogging treatment, C x W = significant interaction between CO{\textsubscript{2}} level and waterlogging treatment). Where interactions were found, waterlogging treatments in which significant differences between aCO{\textsubscript{2}} and eCO{\textsubscript{2}} were determined by post-hoc tests are denoted by: c = control, w = waterlogged, r = recovery. Significant differences between waterlogging treatments determined by post-hoc tests are denoted using the following script: cw = difference between control and waterlogged measurements, cr = difference between control and recovery measurements, wr = difference between waterlogged and recovery measurements. * - interaction effect was marginally significant, but post-hoc analysis confirmed significant differences among treatments.\newline N.B. biomass measurements for waterlogged plants are omitted because these plants were harvested at a younger age than control or recovery plants and are thus not comparable.}
