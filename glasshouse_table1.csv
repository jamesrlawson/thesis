Morphology,"Erect or spreading shrub or tree, 3–8 m high1. Rooting depth 2 m +2","Erect tree, 15–35 m high1. Rooting depth to 8 m2","Large, spreading tree, 30+ m high1. Rooting depth 10 m +2"
Habitat,"Facultative rheophyte. Found in sclerophyll forest, particularly along watercourses and in sandy alluvial soils. Typically on channel banks and raised within-channel features1","Obligate rheophyte. Found along permanent watercourses, on substrates ranging from sand to large cobbles. Often found on bars, benches and channel islands1","Obligate rheophyte. Found on deep, rich alluvial soils, on banks and flood plains associated with large, permanent water bodies1"

Biogeomorphic effects,Colonist of fresh geomorphic substrates?,"Ecosystem engineer. Rapid, en mass colonisation and stabilisation of fresh geomorphic substrates. Established trees stabilise banks and in-channel features2",Ecosystem engineer. Established trees define physical structure of riparian landscapes. Highly effective at mitigation of flooding-induced landform mass failure2
