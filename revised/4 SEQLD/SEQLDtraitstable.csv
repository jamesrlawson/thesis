Growth form,"Categorical description of morphology: tree, shrub, woody climber, herbaceous climber, graminoid, herb.",Differential responses to mechanical and biochemical stresses associated caused by flooding; different strategies for coping with drought and heat stress.,Differential biogeomorphic effects on fluvial landform cohesion and sediment deposition.
Specific leaf area (SLA),Ratio of one-sided leaf area to oven dry mass (cm2 / g).,"SLA is associated with leaf construction cost, photosynthetic rate and carbon : nitrogen economics. Indicator of  ecological strategy under favourable vs. stressful conditions(Wright et al. 2004).",Affects ecosystem productivity and nutrient recycling (Wright et al. 2004).
Leaf area,One-sided leaf area (cm2).,"Shade tolerance (larger leaves) vs. enhanced thermal regulation ability in hot, dry conditions (smaller leaves) (Cornelissen et al. 2003).",May influence flow resistance of vegetation (and therefore fluvial erosion / deposition) when inundated.
Maximum canopy height,Height above ground of apical meristem (m).,Affects ability to tolerate mechanical disturbances such as flooding and maintain xylem integrity in dry conditions (Westoby & Wright 2006).,Determines coarse physical structure of plant community. Surrogate for competitive ability: taller plants receive more light but must construct and maintain support structures (Falster 2006).
Seed mass,"Combined mass of the seed coat, endosperm and embryo (g). Excludes dispersal structures.","Larger seed mass confers ability to establish in unfavourable conditions (Leishman et al. 2000). Also related to seed buoyancy (Carthey 2014, unpublished data).",Seeds may be an important food source for animals.
Wood density,Oven dry mass divided by green volume (g/cm3),"Dense wood tissue confers mechanical strength, but is energetically expensive to construct. Wood density influences ability to tolerate drought stress and disturbance (Telewski 1995; Preston, Cornwell & Denoyer 2006; Lawson et al. 2015).","Regulates decomposition rate; this affects nutrient cycling and determines the residency time of woody debris in the fluvial system (Mackensen, Bauhus & Webber 2003)."
Flowering period length,"Proportion of the year spent in flower (proportion, dimensionless).",Indicates species’ ability to respond reproductively to favourable conditions.,Flowers may be an important food source for animals.
