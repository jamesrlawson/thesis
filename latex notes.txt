use labels and references for all Figures and Tables

san serif font for tables

update how I reference supporting info

symbols in WD map



midrule toprule bottomrule > hline

use \url{} for links

double spacing vs single spacing in tables (tabu vs tabularx?)



'~ mm diameter' doesn't work (textcomp package for tildes, then {\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\mathtt{\sim}$}}
neither do > or <>
actually no symbols work
 | symbol denotes controlled for


need to make sure figures are all on right hand page!

%double spacing

%headers & footers look dumb

bibliography starts half way down the page (and page number is at the bottom rather than the top)

I want to take the square bracket thingys out of the ref list

need J Ecol journal style




pagestyle (changes headers and footers?), chapterstyle (e.g. southall)

renewcommand to change chapter title font
